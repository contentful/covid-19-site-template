If you have information to share during the Covid-19 pandemic, we’re here to help. This solution enables organizations to quickly and easily publish a website. We hope to help communities stay better informed and connected in the midst of closures and quarantine.

## Getting started

```

Or use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli).

```
$ gatsby new covid-19-site-template https://github.com/contentful/covid-19-site-template

```

### Set up of the needed content model and create a configuration file

```
npm i -g contentful-cli
```

```
contentful login
```

```sh
contentful space import --space-id=<space-id> --content-file ./contentful/export.json
```

```
yarn setup
```

![Command line dialog of the yarn run setup command](https://rawgit.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter/master/setup.jpg "Command line dialog of the yarn run setup command")

This command will ask you for a space ID, and access tokens for the Contentful Management and Delivery API. It then imports the content model into the space you define and writes a config file (`.env`).
